    UI/PositionStrategy.lua - Root-frame anchor strategy (UI layout pass §2)

    Position and size are independent concerns: Shell resizes the root
    frame per state, this module owns where that frame's origin sits on
    screen. V1 is a single fixed TOPLEFT anchor/growth strategy - Glance
    and every expanded state share the same screen-space TOPLEFT, and
    resizing always grows right/down from it, never recenters.

    A future pass may pick the anchor/growth direction from where the
    player actually parked the frame (left edge -> grow right, bottom ->
    grow up, etc.) - that's why this is a seam (GetRootAnchor/
    ApplyRootPosition/CaptureSavedPosition) instead of Shell hardcoding
    "TOPLEFT" inline in multiple places.

-- Anchors `frame` to UIParent using the strategy's anchor on both sides,
-- so SetSize()-driven growth always extends away from that one fixed
-- point (right/down for TOPLEFT) regardless of current dimensions.

-- Reads the frame's current position back out as a TOPLEFT-of-frame to
-- TOPLEFT-of-UIParent offset. Deliberately does NOT trust
-- frame:GetPoint()'s reported point/relativePoint/offsets - WoW's own
-- StartMoving()/StopMovingOrSizing() drag commit does not reliably keep
-- reporting the exact anchor pairing ApplyRootPosition set (this was
-- observed producing an impossible positive y offset - off the top of
-- the screen - after a real in-game drag). Absolute screen position
-- (GetLeft/GetTop, scale-corrected) is unambiguous regardless of which
-- corner/relativePoint the drag actually committed to, so the offset is
-- rederived from that instead of read back verbatim.

    -- Back into UIParent's own coordinate space - the units SetPoint
    -- expects for offsets against a UIParent-relative anchor. A frame
    -- entirely on-screen always yields x >= 0 and y <= 0 here.
